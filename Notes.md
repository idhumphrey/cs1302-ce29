## Questions
    i. If you increase X_FINAL to 500 and Y_FINAL to 10000, what do you observe? Because of the way the graph's display is changed with more tick marks but a window of the same size, the linear functions are condensed significantly.  Specifically, I could only distinctly see our x+10.0, the constant function, and the 1.6*n function.
    ii. The graphs only get yet more condensed and while you can still see all three of the functions mentioned in (i.), they are very hard to distiguinsh from one another.
    iii. As Y_FINAL increases, the quadratic functions appear to space out more and then condense again towards the bottom of the screen as Y_FINAL gets larger.
    iv. As Y_FINAL increases the linear functions gets much closer together/
