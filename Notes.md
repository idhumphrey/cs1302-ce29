## Questions
    i. If you increase X_FINAL to 500 and Y_FINAL to 10000, what do you observe? Because of the way the graph's display is changed with more tick marks but a window of the same size, the linear functions are condensed significantly.  Specifically, I could only distinctly see our x+10.0, the constant function, and the 1.6*n function.
    ii. The graphs only get yet more condensed and while you can still see all three of the functions mentioned in (i.), they are very hard to distiguinsh from one another.
    iii. As Y_FINAL get larger, the quadratic functions seem to be much closer in the lower axis, but spread out farther apart from each other higher up the graph.
    iv. As Y_FINAL increases the linear functions get closer together.
    v.  When in the presence of the cubic functions the quadratics have a much lower time complexity which becomes especially clear as Y_FINAL increases.
    vi. The linears have a significantly lower time complexity than both the quadratics and cubics, which I believe reinforces the idea of why we choose the BEST time complexity, aka the lowest power of x possible, when evaluating functions.
    vii. The cubics at first look as if they have a higher time complexity than exponentials but as Y_FINAL increases towards infinity, it becomes clear that the exponentials have a significantly higher time complexity.
    viii. It also appears that the quadratics have a higher than some of the exponential functions at first, however as Y_FINAL increases it too becomes clear that the exponential functions have the highest time complexitites.
    ix. Once again, this just reiterates that the linear functions are MUCH smaller than exponentials and very small overall.
    x.  As mentioned above, I believe this is to show us just how much time complexity matters, and why it is important to choose the best time complexity.
